# 6 Weeks of Wins! : Summer Break

## Internship

The internship was a valuable learning experience. For six weeks, I worked four days a week, five hours a day, and each day brought a new challenge. We didn’t just study theory; we worked on real-world cases that mirrored the kind of incidents cybersecurity professionals deal with. One standout task was when we had to respond to the CrowdStrike outage.

It wasn’t just about reading headlines; we were tasked with creating a detailed incident report on what had happened, why, and how we could prevent something similar from occurring in the future. It was an eye-opener for me because I realized that cybersecurity isn’t just about protecting systems—it’s about staying ahead of the game, predicting vulnerabilities before they’re exploited.

## Hanging Out With Friends

But of course, all work and no play wasn’t an option, and my friends and I made sure to maximize the summer weekends and evenings. Despite everyone juggling different work schedules, we managed to explore some great places together. One of the highlights was Manhattan. There’s something electric about the city, especially in summer. We spent hours wandering through the streets, trying different foods, and soaking in the vibrant energy of the city.

One day, we decided to explore Central Park. It’s such a huge place that you can always find something new, no matter how many times you go. We walked through shaded pathways, stumbled upon hidden bridges. It felt like we were in the heart of New York's soul—so peaceful yet alive. We even had a little picnic by the water, which turned into one of those moments you know you’ll remember years from now.

## Family Shopping Spree

Among all the fun with friends, I also carved out time for a family shopping spree with my sister. It was one of those days where everything just aligned perfectly. We decided to go to Macy’s Herald Square, which is always an adventure with its sheer size and variety. We each found a few new pieces of clothing, but the real highlight was afterward when we went for food.

My sister suggested we try bb.q chicken, which was located nearby. I’ve had my fair share of good food in the city, but this was on another level. The chicken was perfectly crispy, juicy, and bursting with flavor. I’m not exaggerating when I say it was the best chicken I’ve ever had in my life. If you ever find yourself near Macy’s, I couldn’t recommend it more highly.

That day wasn’t just about shopping; it was about creating memories with family, which can be rare when everyone has their own busy schedule.

## Reuniting With A Friend

To top off what was already a fantastic summer, I experienced a full-circle moment when I reconnected with an old friend from my Minecraft days. Back in 2021, we used to spend hours playing HCF (Hardcore Factions), but we lost touch when the game started to lose its popularity. I hadn’t thought much about it since then until one day, while scrolling through my Valorant friends list, I saw his username.

I immediately sent him a message, and before I knew it, we were in a game together, talking about all the fun times we had on Minecraft. It was crazy how, even after all that time, it felt like we picked up right where we left off. Now, we’re gaming more than ever, making new memories while still talking about the old ones.

## Overall

This summer was about balance between work and fun, past and present. The internship gave me practical skills and opened my eyes to the realities of cybersecurity, while my adventures with friends and family brought fun and joy. And reconnecting with my old friend was a reminder that no matter how much things change, some bonds never really fade.
