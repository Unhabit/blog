The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated bird that descends from the red junglefowl, originating in Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Chickens are primarily raised for their meat and eggs, with a global population exceeding 26 billion as of 2023, making them the most common type of poultry worldwide. They exhibit a variety of breeds and sizes, characterized by their round bodies, short wings, and social behavior that establishes a pecking order within flocks.

## How does chicken benefit us humans?

Chicken offers numerous health benefits, making it a valuable addition to the human diet. It is an excellent source of high-quality protein, which is essential for building and repairing tissues, maintaining muscle mass, and supporting overall metabolic functions. A typical serving of chicken provides important vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins (such as niacin and B12), selenium, phosphorus, and zinc, which contribute to energy production, immune function, and bone health. Additionally, chicken is low in calories and fat, particularly when skinless, making it a heart-healthy alternative to red meats. Regular consumption of chicken can aid in weight management by promoting feelings of fullness due to its protein content, while also being linked to improved mood through the presence of tryptophan, which may enhance serotonin levels in the brain.

### Tandoori Chicken

Tandoori chicken is a popular Indian dish made by marinating chicken in a mixture of yogurt and spices, then cooking it in a tandoor, which is a traditional cylindrical clay oven. The marinade typically includes ingredients such as garlic, ginger, garam masala, and red chili powder, giving the chicken its distinctive flavor and vibrant red color. The marinated chicken is often left to soak overnight, allowing the spices to penetrate deeply and tenderize the meat. Cooking in the tandoor exposes the chicken to high temperatures, resulting in a smoky flavor and a charred exterior while keeping the meat juicy and flavorful. Tandoori chicken is commonly served with accompaniments like naan bread, mint chutney, and various side dishes, making it a favorite Indian cuisine.
