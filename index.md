 ## About me
Hello, my name is Nahid. I'm originally from Bangladesh, but I was born in New York. I'm currently focused on learning Full-Stack Development, with the goal of landing a job in the high-tech industry, where I hope to build a successful career and make a lot of money. If that doesn't work out, I have a backup plan to pursue a real estate degree and get into the real estate business. I'm passionate about technology, and I'm determined to make one of these paths work for me.
